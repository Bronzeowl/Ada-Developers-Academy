#### 2.	How many wind based storms happened between 8AM PST and 11AM PST in 1957?

There were 76 wind based storms that happened between 8AM PST and 11AM PST in 1975.

#### Explanation

Prior to answering the question, I excluded all rows of data that have a County/Parish, Zone or Marine name that begins with a vowel from the 1957 data. I accomplished this by using the filter function in Excel on the column entitled "cz_name". I could only exclude two variables at one time. This meant that I had to repeat this step three times to filter out all of the names that start with a vowel since there are five vowels: A, E, I, O and U. 

After the initial step, I filtered out any storm event that was not "wind based". This could be found under the column entitled “event_type”. This column indicated the type of storm that happened in a particular area. The three options in this category is "Hail", "Thunderstorm Wind" and "Tornado". Since there was no single option for just "wind based" storms I filtered out all of the options except for Thunderstorm Wind.  This left me with all of the rows of data that experienced a Thunderstorm Wind event. Now I needed to be able to extract all of the times from the data. The first issue was that the times are in the same column as the dates so I needed to find a way to separate the dates and times. In addition, there are two sets of times (begin and end) and the times are in Central Standard Time. The first challenge I tackled was to separate the dates and times. I accomplished this by using an equation to turn the dates and times into an integer [=INT(R3)]. I then used an equation to subtract out the integer from the original date and time column which provided me a separate column with just the time [=R2-BB2]. I did this for both the “Begin Date Time” column and the “End Date Time” column. At this point I had to tackle the second issue of converting the times from Central Standard Time to Pacific Standard Time. I accomplished this in Excel by using an equation to convert all of the times for both the Begin and End data [=BC2+(22/24)]. The next goal was to figure out a way to count all of the times between 8AM and 11AM from both the Begin and End columns. Upon further inspection of the times, I realized that the times are exactly the same for the Begin and End data. This simplified the issue because I would only need to find a way to count the data in one column rather than two. I set up an equation in Excel to count how many times a value equal to or greater than 8AM appeared in the column [=SUM((HOUR(BG2:BG679)>=8)*1)]. This value was determined to be 602. Then I set up an equation to count how many times a value greater than 11AM appeared [=SUM((HOUR(BG2:BG679)>11)*1)]. This value was determined to be 526. I subtracted 526 from 602 and arrived at the answer of 76 which provided me with the number of times a wind stormed event happened between 8AM PST and 11AM PST in 1975.
