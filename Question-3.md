#### In which year (1957 or 2007) did storms have a higher monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase territory?

The year 2007 has a higher monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase territory.

#### Explanation

Prior to answering the question, I excluded all rows of data that have a County/Parish, Zone or Marine name that begins with a vowel from the 2007 and 1957 data. I accomplished this by using the filter function in Excel. Since I could only exclude 2 variables at one time, I had to repeat this step 3 times to filter out all of the names that start with a vowel for both sets of data since there are 5 vowels: A, E, I O and U. 

The biggest challenge for this question was determining how to only include the sections of the United States that was part of the Louisiana Purchase territory. This was difficult since the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase territory covers many states, but also only covers some states partially. So I decided that I would not be able to simply filter out the data according to the States that are considered to be a part of the terrritory. When I looked at the type of data that is provided in the files I noticed that the longitude and latitude coordinates are provided for where the storm events took place. I decided that I would approach this question by using the coordinates since that would allow me to be more specific with the data. I tried looking up the coordinates for the Louisiana Purchase territory, but there did not seem to be any resources that provided defined values. So what I decided to do was look at a map of the territory with coordinates and assign approximate values. When I was browsing at the map, I quickly realized that since the territory is such an awkward shape that I could not simply just use one set of coordinates; but I did decide that I could split the territory up into 4 sections. I tried to break the sections up into blocks that encompassed each area with the best fit and then I assigned coordinates. I used this approach for the first three sections. These are the values that I assigned for the first three sections: 42N, 49N, -112W and -90W. I approached the fourth section differently because it is the smallest section of the territory and the state of Louisiana pretty much encompasses that particular part of the Louisiana Purchase. 

I sorted the data out one section at a time since they all had separate coordinates. When I had one section sorted out according to its coordinates, I then had to determine the monetary impact. The data set contains 2 columns that indicate monetary impact. These columns are labeled “damage_property” and “damage_crops”. Since the question did not specify to determine a difference between property and crops, I decided to determine the total amount of monetary impact that included both variables. I first tackled the monetary damage for property. After filtering the data out according to the coordinates of a particular section, I then filtered out the values that were equal to zero or was missing any data in the property column. At that point, the column consisted of various and multiple monetary values so I used Excel to remove the duplicates. I copied the column and removed the duplicates on a separate worksheet in order to not disturb the sorted data. This left me with a list of unique values that are in the column. I was then able to use a countif equation to count how many times those individual values appeared in the property column [=COUNTIF(Y:Y,"="&BA3)]. Once I knew how many times each value occurred, I set up an equation in Excel to multiply the monetary value by the number of times it appears [=BC3*BB3]. This provided me with a total monetary amount for each individual value. I  then used Excel to sum the values and this provided the total amount of monetary damage to property [=SUM(BE3:BE92)]. This process was repeated to sort out the total amount of damage of property for each section for both years. It was also repeated in order to gain the total amount of damage to crops for each section for both years.

As I mentioned before, the one caveat to this process includes the fourth section. Instead of using coordinates, I filtered the data by only selecting the state of Louisiana because this section of the territory consisted mainly of the state of Louisiana. When I had sorted out all of the other states, my next step was to sort out all of the counties that were not included in the boundaries of the territory in Louisiana. I looked at a map and saw that the territory boundary did not include land that is East of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. I then looked up a map that outlined all of the counties in Louisiana and any of the counties that were East of the Mississippi River I filtered out of the "cz_name" column. At this point, I repeated the same process for filtering and summing the property column as I did previously for the other sections. This is also how I determined the total amount of damage of crops for the fourth section. This process was applied to both years.

For the year of 1957, the total amount of monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase was $64,258,990. For the year of 2007, the total amount of monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase was $2,032,959,350. Although this may suggest that 2007 incurred the largest amount of monetary damage I decided to adjust the values for inflation in 2016. This changes the monetary total for 1957 to  $541,778,749.99 versus the monetary total for 2007 to $2,322,928,289.32. This makes 2007 the year that storms created the greatest monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase territory.
