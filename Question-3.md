#### In which year (1957 or 2007) did storms have a higher monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase territory?

The year 1957 has a higher monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase territory.

#### Explanation

Prior to answering the question, I excluded all rows of data that have a County/Parish, Zone or Marine name that begins with a vowel from the 2007 data. I accomplished this by using the filter function in Excel. Since I could only exclude 2 variables at one time, I had to repeat this step 3 times to filter out all of the names that start with a vowel since there are 5 vowels: A, E, I O and U. Initially, I had tried to use the ‘Advanced’ filter function, but I was unable to get the desired result. I tried troubleshooting the issue, but I could not find any appropriate resources to answer my question and it was also causing me to mismanage my time appropriately so although the path I ended up choosing to filter out the names took a few more steps it did accomplish the task.

The biggest challenge for this question was determining how to only include the sections of the United States that was part of the Louisiana Purchase territory. Especially since the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase territory is an awkward shape. So I would not be able to simply filter out the data according to the States that are a part of the terrritory. So looking at the event details that were provided in the file I saw that the longitude and latitude coordinates were provided for where the storm events took place. I tried looking up the coordinates for the Louisiana Purchase territory, but there did not seem to be any resources that provided defined coordinates. So what I decided to do was look at a map of the territory with coordinates and assign approximate values. I quickly realized that since the territory is such an awkward shape that I could not simply just use one set of coordinates. By reviewing a map I realized that I could split the territory up in 4 sections. I tried to break the sections up into blocks that encompassed that area within the territory boundaries as tightly as possible and then I assigned coordinates for the first three sections. I approached the fourth section differently because I had it consist of the state of Louisiana since that was the smallest section of the territory and the state of Louisiana encompassed that whole part of the Louisiana Purchase.

So what I had to do was sort the data out one section at a time since they all had separate coordinates. Once I had one section sorted out according to coordinates, I then had to determine the monetary impact. The data set contains 2 columns that indicate monetary impact. These columns are labeled “damage_property” and “damage_crops”. Since the question did not specify to determine a difference between property and crops, I decided to determine total amount of monetary impact for both variables. I first tackled the monetary damage for property. After filtering the data out according to coordinates of a particular section, I then filtered out any values that were equaled to zero and any data that had blanks in property column. So what I wanted to do at that point is count how many times each value occurred, but I had to figure out how to determine how many individual values were present. I used Excel to remove the duplicate values. This left me with a list of unique identifiers which I used in a countif equation to count how many times those individual values appeared in the column. Once I knew how many times each value occurred, I set up an equation in Excel to multiply the monetary value by the number of times it appears. This provided me with a total monetary amount for each individual value. I  then used Excel to sum the values and this provided the total amount of damage of property. This process was repeated to sort out the total amount of damage of property for each section and it was also repeated in order to gain the total amount of damage of crops for each section. 

As I mentioned before, the one caveat to this process includes the fourth section. Instead of using coordinates, I filtered the data by only selecting the state of Louisiana because this section of the territory consisted completely of the state of Louisiana. When I had sorted out all of the other states, my next step was to sort out all of the counties that were not included in the boundaries of the territory. The counties are listed under under the column entitled “cz_name”. I looked at a map and saw that the territory boundary did not include counties that were East of the Mississippi River. I then looked up a map of Louisiana that outlined all of the counties in Louisiana and any of the counties that were East of the Mississippi River I filtered out. At this point, I repeated the same process for filtering and summing the columns for property and crops.

For the year of 1957, the total amount of monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase was $64,258,990. For the year of 2007, the total amount of monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase was $2,032,959,350. Although this may suggest that 2007 incurred the largest amount of monetary damage the values had to be adjusted for inflation. This changes the monetary total for 1957 to  $541,778,749.99 versus the monetary total for 2007 which is $241,124,101.94. This makes 1957 the year that storms created the greatest monetary impact within the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase territory.
