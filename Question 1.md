#### 1.How many counties in the state of Washington remained storm free in 2007?

18 counties remained storm free in the state of Washington in 2007.

##### Explanation:
Prior to answering the question, I excluded all rows of data that have a County/Parish, Zone or Marine name that begins with a vowel from the 2007 data. I accomplished this by using the filter function in Excel on the column entitled "cz_name". I could only exclude two variables at one time. This meant that I had to repeat this step three times to filter out all of the names that start with a vowel since there are five vowels: A, E, I, O and U. Initially, I had tried to use the ‘Advanced’ filter function, but I was unable to get the desired result. I had tried troubleshooting the issue, but I could not find the appropriate resources to address my concerns. Also, the time of troubleshooting was decreasing my productivity so I decided to follow through with my former solution because I needed to move forward with my progress.

After the initial step, I filtered out all of states except for Washington by using the filter function. In addition, since the question is strictly asking for the number of counties filtered out all of the Zones and Marinas. This was accomplished by using the filter function on the column entitled “cz_type”. The letter “C” represents the county, “Z” represents the Zone and “M” represents the Marina where the event took place so I made sure to filter out all of the Zones and Marinas. The next step was to take out any duplicates of a County name since we don’t need to know how many occurrences of storms happened, but rather how many counties experienced some type of storm event. At this point, the number of rows that are left express how many counties experienced an event, but not how many counties remained storm free. The unasked question I had to answer was the number of counties in the stae of Washington. I accomplished this by looking online. What I discovered was that the state of Washington has 39 counties and according to the data there are 21 counties that had some type of storm event in 2007. By subtracting the number of counties that had events from the total number of counties in the State the result is 18. The answer is that 18 counties in Washington did not have any storm events logged for the year of 2007.
